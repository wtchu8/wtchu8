# Winston T. Chu, Ph.D.

I am a postdoctoral fellow at the NIH. I love all things imaging, AI, and medicine.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a MONAI/PyTorch pipeline for deep learning organ segmentation of chest CT images
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to tune self-supervised tasks to improve deep learning organ segmentation using unlabeled CT scans
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on infectious disease imaging datasets
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I would be happy to connect on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/wtchu/
- âš¡ Fun fact: I play the ukulele in my free time
